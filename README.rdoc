= Filtration
Filtration is a clean, lightweight way to filter arguments going into and out of methods.

== Usage
Example:
  class Bar
    def foo(x)
      x + 2
    end
    def foo_top(x)
      x + 2
    end
  end
  
  class Foo < Bar
    prefilter(:foo){|x| x * 2} # (x * 2) + 2
    postfilter(:foo){|x| x * 2} # (x + 2) * 2
  end 

== Requirements
Filtration stands on its own!

== Development
RSpec is used for testing.
